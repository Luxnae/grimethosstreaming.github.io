            </div>
            <div class="text-4">
                <p><br>Gaming Content: This is generally the most used content out there since gaming is interesting<br> and can create communities and connect other people to each other. This content has the streamer <br>playing different types of games the audience has played, will play, or will never be able to play.<br>
                    Demographic ( since different streaming websites have different demographics, we will focus on <br>twitch since it mostly consists of game streams.)<br>
                    ➨ Age - 70% of Twitch viewers are between the ages of 16 and 34, with the remaining 30% are people <br>that are 35+ years old.<br>
                    ➨ Gender - Twitch’s demographic consists of 65% male users with the remaining 35% as the female <br>audience excluding those who identify themselves otherwise.<br>
                    Opinion <br>
                    ➨ For the community—to be part of something larger than oneself<br>
                    ➨ For the inclusion—to feel accepted<br>
                    ➨ For the fun of it—to escape<br>
                    ➨ For the desire to improve—to learn new skills<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>Music Content: Music is everywhere so there is no doubt music content is widespread and a lot of people have heard about music. <br>Music can change lives, maybe not in a big part of our lives but the parts where there is emotional damage.<br>
                        Demographic<br>
                        ➨ Age - 68% of adults aged between 18 and 34 years leaving 32% are ages 35+.<br>
                        ➨ Gender - men by 97.7% and women 2.3%<br>
                        Opinion<br>
                        ➨ Music can help calm the minds of listeners, well that is depending on the type of music you listen to. 
                        It can help ease the stress and loneliness.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>Vlog Contents: Vlog contents have started to pop up more frequently as many people are continually watching this type of content on the internet. <br>
                        Demographic<br>
                        ➨ Age - Ages 16 - 24<br>
                        ➨ Gender - 78% male and 22% female<br>
                        Opinion<br>
                        ➨ Some vloggers are relatable since their contents are mostly travel, lifestyle and others.
                        Watching how people are in their daily lives is very<br> interesting since two or more people aren’t the same, they live differently.<br>

                <p><br>Need of viewers for the 3 types of content<br>
                    ➨The interaction you get when you have viewers is very different when you are doing things alone. <br>Having viewers, you have their opinions on what to decide on next or where to go next.<br>
                    ➨Viewers share your triumphant moments and your losing moments, sharing the emotions <br>you feel feels like you’re there with them when you achieve those moments.<br>
                    ➨Viewers can also become the people you can come to, since most viewers sympathize<br> with the content creator on what they are going through at the moment.

                <p><br>A good stream needs of course good but equipment is not always everything. <br>You need to interest the viewers, to do that, write an interesting title and create <br>a nice thumbnail. The first thing the viewers will see will be the thumbnail and the <br>title, if the title doesn't peak there interest, most won't bother watching your stream. <br>What else is needed? Your personality, bring it to the stream to make it more <br>interesting and make the viewers think that they are your friends hanging out with you.</p>
